# Complete Payment Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the "Complete Payment" feature that allows administrators to send payment links to customers for completing partial or remaining payments on their bookings.

## Feature Workflow

### 1. Admin Interface (`bladeBookings.php`)
- Added "Complete Payment" option in the action dropdown menu for each booking
- Created a modal dialog that displays:
  - Booking details (package, date, time, total price)
  - Editable amount field with automatic calculation based on payment type
  - Options to send link via SMS and/or WhatsApp

### 2. Payment Amount Calculation
The initial amount is automatically calculated based on the `payment` JSON column's `type` field:

- **Type 0 (Partial Payment)**: 
  - Amount = `booking_price - price`
  - This is the remaining amount after partial payment

- **Type 1 (Fully Paid)**: 
  - Amount = `0`
  - Any amount entered is considered additional/extra

- **Type 2 (Cash Payment)**: 
  - Amount = `booking_price`
  - Full amount needs to be paid

### 3. Backend Processing (`apiCompletePaymentLink.php`)

#### If Admin Changes the Amount:
1. Creates a **NEW** booking record with:
   - Same details as original booking
   - New `booking_price` = admin's entered amount
   - Updated `payment` JSON with:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "original_type",
       "price": "original_price",
       "booking_price": "original_booking_price",
       "final_price": "new_amount",
       "completion_status": "pending",
       "original_booking_id": "original_booking_id"
     }
     ```
2. Generates payment link via payment gateway API
3. Sends SMS/WhatsApp with the link

#### If Admin Keeps the Same Amount:
1. Updates the EXISTING booking's `payment` JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "original_type",
     "price": "original_price", 
     "booking_price": "booking_price",
     "final_price": "amount",
     "completion_status": "pending"
   }
   ```
2. Generates payment link pointing to existing booking
3. Sends SMS/WhatsApp with the link

### 4. Customer Payment Page (`bladeCompletePayment.php`)
- Displays full booking details
- Shows the amount to be paid
- "Proceed to Payment" button redirects to payment gateway
- Integrated with existing payment flow

### 5. Payment Processing (`process.php`)
- Modified to detect completion payments via `is_completion_payment` flag
- For completion payments:
  - Uses existing booking details
  - Creates payment gateway request
  - Redirects to payment gateway

### 6. Payment Callback Handler (`payment.php` - `checkCreateAPI()`)
Modified to handle completion payment callbacks:

#### On Success:
- Updates `payment` JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "completion_status": "success"
  }
  ```
- Changes booking `status` to **"Completed"**
- Records gateway response

#### On Failure:
- Updates `payment` JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "completion_status": "failed"
  }
  ```
- Keeps original booking status
- Records gateway response

## Database Changes

### Payment Column JSON Structure
```json
{
  "type": "0|1|2",
  "price": "original_paid_amount",
  "booking_price": "total_booking_price",
  "final_price": "completion_payment_amount",
  "completion_status": "pending|success|failed",
  "original_booking_id": "id_if_new_booking_created"
}
```

### New Booking Status
- Added **"Completed"** status for bookings with successful completion payments
- Added to status filter buttons in admin interface
- Integrated with existing status dropdown options

## Files Modified

1. **admin/views/bladeBookings.php**
   - Added Complete Payment button and modal
   - Added JavaScript handlers for modal and API calls
   - Added "Completed" status filter

2. **requests/booking/apiGetBookingPaymentInfo.php** (NEW)
   - Returns payment JSON and booking price for a booking

3. **requests/booking/apiCompletePaymentLink.php** (NEW)
   - Handles payment link generation
   - Creates new booking if amount changed
   - Sends SMS/WhatsApp notifications

4. **views/bladeCompletePayment.php**
   - Customer-facing payment page
   - Displays booking details and payment form

5. **payment/process.php**
   - Modified to handle completion payments
   - Detects `is_completion_payment` flag
   - Processes completion payment requests

6. **admin/includes/functions/payment.php**
   - Modified `checkCreateAPI()` function
   - Handles completion payment callbacks
   - Updates payment JSON with completion status

7. **requests/booking/apiBookingList.php**
   - Added "Completed" status handling in filters
   - Added status translation for "Completed"

## Notification Messages

### SMS/WhatsApp Message Format
- English: "Complete your payment for {package_name}. Amount: {amount} KD. Click here: {link}"
- Arabic: "أكمل دفعتك لـ {package_name}. المبلغ: {amount} د.ك. اضغط هنا: {link}"

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin can open Complete Payment modal
- [ ] Amount is calculated correctly based on payment type
- [ ] Admin can edit the amount
- [ ] Payment link is generated correctly
- [ ] SMS is sent (if selected)
- [ ] WhatsApp is sent (if selected)
- [ ] Customer can access payment page via link
- [ ] Payment gateway integration works
- [ ] Success callback updates status to "Completed"
- [ ] Failed callback keeps original status
- [ ] Payment JSON is updated correctly
- [ ] "Completed" status filter works in admin panel

## Security Considerations

1. All booking IDs are validated and sanitized
2. Payment amounts are validated (must be > 0)
3. SMS/WhatsApp credentials are stored securely in database
4. Payment gateway API key is stored in config
5. All user inputs are escaped before database operations

## Future Enhancements

1. Add payment history tracking
2. Show completion payment details in booking details modal
3. Add ability to resend payment link
4. Add email notification option
5. Generate invoice PDF for completion payments
6. Add refund functionality
